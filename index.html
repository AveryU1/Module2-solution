            <h2 id="t1">Home Alone 2</h2>
            <p> At the height of the Christmas holidays, little Kevin McCallister and his family are about to catch a plane to enjoy a little vacation, but Kevin makes a mistake and boards a plane that takes him to New York, where he finds himself alone and unprotected again.</p>

            <h2 id="t2">Die Hard</h2>
            <p>The NYPD, played by Bruce Willis, simply wanted to go to a party on Christmas Eve,
            but ended up fighting terrorists led by Alan Rickman, walking barefoot on shards of glass and crawling through vents to save attendees at the party and (just maybe) reconcile with his wife.</p>

            <h2 id="t3">Klaus</h2>
            <p>Sergio Pablos created one of the best Christmas movies with this Oscar-nominated Netflix original animated film that makes up a beautiful tale to create a charming origin to Santa Klaus.</p>
